//! `cargo hakari` is a command-line application to manage workspace-hack crates.
//!
//! For an explanation of what workspace-hack packages are and how they can help, see the
//! [`about` module](https://docs.rs/cargo-hakari/*/cargo_hakari/about).
//!
//! # Platform support
//!
//! * **Unix platforms**: Hakari works and is supported.
//! * **Windows**: Hakari works and outputs file paths with forward slashes for
//!   consistency with Unix. CRLF line endings are not supported in the workspace-hack's
//!   `Cargo.toml` -- it is recommended that repositories disable automatic line ending conversion.
//!   [Here's how to do it in Git](https://stackoverflow.com/a/10017566).
//!   (Pull requests to improve this are welcome.)
//!
//! # Installation and usage
//!
//! All of the below commands take options that control their behavior.
//!
//! To install, run:
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo install cargo-hakari
//! ```
//!
//! To update, run:
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo install --force cargo-hakari
//! ```
//!
//! If `$HOME/.cargo/bin` is in your `PATH`, the `cargo hakari` command will be available.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! Initialize a workspace-hack crate for a workspace at path `my-workspace-hack`:
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo hakari init my-workspace-hack
//! ```
//!
//! Generate or update the contents of a workspace-hack crate.
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo hakari generate
//! ```
//!
//! Add the workspace-hack crate as a dependency to all other workspace crates:
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo hakari manage-deps
//! ```
//!
//! Publish a crate that currently depends on the workspace-hack crate (`cargo publish` can't be
//! used in this circumstance):
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo hakari publish -p <crate>
//! ```
//!
//! ## Disabling and uninstalling
//!
//! Disable the workspace-hack crate temporarily by removing generated contents. (Re-enable by
//! running `cargo hakari generate`).
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo hakari disable
//! ```
//!
//! Remove the workspace-hack crate as a dependency from all other workspace crates:
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo hakari remove-deps
//! ```
//!
//! # Configuration
//!
//! `cargo hakari` is configured through `.guppy/hakari.toml` at the root of the workspace.
//!
//! Example configuration:
//!
//! ```toml
//! ## The name of the package used for workspace-hack unification.
//! hakari-package = "workspace-hack"
//! ## Cargo resolver version in use -- version 2 is highly recommended.
//! resolver = "2"
//!
//! ## Add triples corresponding to platforms commonly used by developers here.
//! ## https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/platform-support.html
//! platforms = [
//!     ## "x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu",
//!     ## "x86_64-apple-darwin",
//!     ## "x86_64-pc-windows-msvc",
//! ]
//!
//! ## Options to control Hakari output.
//! [output]
//! ## Write out exact versions rather than specifications. Set this to true if version numbers in
//! ## `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock` files are kept in sync, e.g. in some configurations of
//! ## https://dependabot.com/.
//! ## exact-versions = false
//! ```
//!
//! For more options, see the [`config` module](https://docs.rs/cargo-hakari/*/cargo_hakari/config).
