//! Track and query Cargo dependency graphs.
//!
//! `guppy` provides a Rust interface to run queries over Cargo dependency graphs. `guppy` parses
//! the output of  [`cargo metadata`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-metadata.html),
//! then presents a graph interface over it.
//!
//! # Types and lifetimes
//!
//! The central structure exposed by `guppy` is [`PackageGraph`](crate::graph::PackageGraph). This
//! represents a directed (though [not necessarily acyclic](crate::graph::Cycles)) graph where every
//! node is a package and every edge represents a dependency.
//!
//! Other types borrow data from a `PackageGraph` and have a `'g` lifetime parameter indicating
//! that. A lifetime parameter named `'g` always indicates that data is borrowed from a
//! `PackageGraph`.
//!
//! [`PackageMetadata`](crate::graph::PackageMetadata) contains information about individual
//! packages, such as the data in
//! [the `[package]` section](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-package-section).
//!
//! For traversing the graph, `guppy` provides a few types:
//! * [`PackageLink`](crate::graph::PackageLink) represents both ends of a dependency edge, along
//!   with details about the dependency (whether it is dev-only, platform-specific, and so on).
//! * [`PackageQuery`](crate::graph::PackageQuery) represents the input parameters to a dependency
//!   traversal: a set of packages and a direction. A traversal is performed with
//!   [`PackageQuery::resolve`](crate::graph::PackageQuery::resolve), and fine-grained control over
//!   the traversal is achieved with
//!   [`PackageQuery::resolve_with_fn`](crate::graph::PackageQuery::resolve_with_fn).
//! * [`PackageSet`](crate::graph::PackageSet) represents the result of a graph traversal. This
//!   struct provides several methods to iterate over packages.
//!
//! For some operations, `guppy` builds an auxiliary [`FeatureGraph`](crate::graph::feature::FeatureGraph)
//! the first time it is required. Every node in a `FeatureGraph` is a combination of a package and
//! a feature declared in it, and every edge is a feature dependency.
//!
//! For traversing the feature graph, `guppy` provides the analogous [`FeatureQuery`](crate::graph::feature::FeatureQuery) and
//! [`FeatureSet`](crate::graph::feature::FeatureSet) types.
//!
//! `FeatureSet` also has an [`into_cargo_set`](crate::graph::feature::FeatureSet::into_cargo_set)
//! method, to simulate Cargo builds. This method produces a [`CargoSet`](crate::graph::cargo::CargoSet),
//! which is essentially two `FeatureSet`s along with some more useful information.
//!
//! `guppy`'s data structures are immutable, with some internal caches. All of `guppy`'s types are
//! `Send + Sync`, and all lifetime parameters are [covariant](https://github.com/sunshowers/lifetime-variance-example/).
//!
//! # Optional features
//!
//! * `proptest1`: Support for [property-based testing](https://jessitron.com/2013/04/25/property-based-testing-what-is-it/)
//!   using the [`proptest`](https://altsysrq.github.io/proptest-book/intro.html) framework.
//! * `rayon1`: Support for parallel iterators through [Rayon](docs.rs/rayon/1) (preliminary work
//!   so far, more parallel iterators to be added in the future).
//! * `summaries`: Support for writing out [build summaries](https://github.com/facebookincubator/cargo-guppy/tree/main/guppy-summaries).
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Print out all direct dependencies of a package:
//!
//! ```
//! use guppy::{CargoMetadata, PackageId};
//!
//! // `guppy` accepts `cargo metadata` JSON output. Use a pre-existing fixture for these examples.
//! let metadata = CargoMetadata::parse_json(include_str!("../../fixtures/small/metadata1.json")).unwrap();
//! let package_graph = metadata.build_graph().unwrap();
//!
//! // `guppy` provides several ways to get hold of package IDs. Use a pre-defined one for this
//! // example.
//! let package_id = PackageId::new("testcrate 0.1.0 (path+file:///fakepath/testcrate)");
//!
//! // The `metadata` method returns information about the package, or `None` if the package ID
//! // wasn't recognized.
//! let package = package_graph.metadata(&package_id).unwrap();
//!
//! // `direct_links` returns all direct dependencies of a package.
//! for link in package.direct_links() {
//!     // A dependency link contains `from()`, `to()` and information about the specifics of the
//!     // dependency.
//!     println!("direct dependency: {}", link.to().id());
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! For more examples, see
//! [the `examples` directory](https://github.com/facebookincubator/cargo-guppy/tree/main/guppy/examples).
